              I am CURRENTLY planning on covering API integration and potentially a filtering/recommendation system with a MySQL database. Me and my partner
              want to showcase this (and potentially other technologies, we're not sure yet) by creating a mixed drink recipe app that uses a combinaition of 
              API calls for drink information and a database for storing drink information to filter (primarily by the name of the drink + a list of required ingredients).
